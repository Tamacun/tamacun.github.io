**People ask how we deal with copycat businesses, and the answer is always the same...**

If they can survive doing what we do, Go Ahead!

San Marcos is officially our 3rd Location (our [2 locations in Vista](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sae+Kitchen+Rental/@33.1491275,-117.2245377,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x809991c0d05ad4b7:0x30433f649eae49af!8m2!3d33.149123!4d-117.222349) have since been merged) and it was definitely our biggest challenge to date.

Our secret to survival:


### Persistence


You simply can't give up in business. Persistence will always get you to the finish line (what the finish line looks like is a post for another day).


Whether you're starting a [Food Truck](https://www.upcounsel.com/how-to-start-a-food-truck-in-california), a [Farmers Market Stall](http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/deh/fhd/food/cep/tempevent_vendorapp_fp.pdf), or any [other food-based small business](http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/deh/fhd/food/foodhandler.html), **don't give up**. We have seen many successful startups come through our doors. Time and again, the ones that flourish are the ones that persist in the face of difficulty.

Good ideas, good marketing, and natural talent will only get you so far. We've seen businesses that blew us away at first, only to give up in under six months, without turning a profit.

Our sweat, tears, and savings accounts made this new location possible. It is our sincere hope that you can follow our example, be persistent, and find success.
